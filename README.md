A weather app, nothing else!
Just simply wanted to do it for fun and to increase my skills ;d

# Usage

Enter the `CITY-COUNTRYCODE`, then the weather (and weather condition) will be retrieved.
If you enter an invalid city, the DOM will be updated telling you that the city is invalid.

This uses window local storage to save the input, and retrieve it once the website is opened again and also this doesn't use anything but pure javascript and html-css.
